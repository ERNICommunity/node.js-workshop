================

:warning: **REPOSITORY NOT ACTIVE SINCE 2014 Dependabot alerts disabled**

The node.js-workshop repository contains material for a basic introduction to node.js. There are some slides briefly introducing the key concept of node.js together with basic exercises and its solutions

The introduction slides are terminated by a typical HelloWorld example, whereas the participants can practice the first usage of a callback method and it's syntax. The HelloWorld application is continued by another four tasks which get a bit more exciting and challenging. In the last task a chat room application is provided which already covers the most of the key concepts of Node.js.

To follow up with the examples from the Node.js workshop start with the exercises

To you compare your results with the final version, have a look at the solutions. To get the solutions for the tasks 04 and 05 working you have to install the required modules that you can see at the top of the main .js file. To install the modules use the node package manager from the console and type:

npm install socket.io
and/or
npm install express
